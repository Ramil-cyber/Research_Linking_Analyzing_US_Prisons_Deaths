The arrestee was being transported to the Kenosha County Jail for criminal charges by two Pleasant Prairie Police Officers.  While driving the squad on Sheridan Road near the entrance of the Kenosha County Jail, officers heard a gun shot from the backseat prisoner portion of the squad.  Preliminary information indicates the arrestee suffered a self-inflicted gun shot wound from a concealed weapon not located in the initial search by officers.  Life saving measures were attempted, however the arrestee was pronounced deceased at the scene. As required by Wisconsin State Statute 175.47, this incident will be investigated by an outside law enforcement agency. The Racine County Sheriff’s Office will conduct this investigation with the full cooperation of our Department as we are committed to full transparency. Our thoughts are with all law enforcement personnel involved with this incident and the decedent’s family during this tragic time.  We wish to thank the public for their continued support, and we ask for your patience and understanding while this matter is under investigation.",

They repeatedly asked Alsleben to surrender but did not go inside. They couldn’t see him initially and he did not respond to their commands.According to body camera video, something appeared to be burning in the apartment. The officers and deputies then entered and saw Alsleben lying on the living room floor with a large hunting-style knife in his hand.They attempted to take him into custody, but he struggled and cut one of the officers. Two McLeod County deputies attempted without success to use their Tasers. Alsleben then stood up, still holding the knife, and three Hutchinson officers fired, fatally striking him. The BCA identified the law enforcement officers as Hutchinson officer Taylor Fenrich, who fired his duty pistol and has 17 years of law enforcement experience; Hutchinson officer Phillip Mielke, who fired his patrol rifle and has nine years of experience; Hutchinson officer Tyler Schmeling, who fired his patrol rifle and has eight years of experience; McLeod County deputy Andrew Demeyer, who discharged his Taser and has 16 years of experience; and McLeod County deputy David Olson, who discharged his Taser and has 17 years of experience.",

Powell parked his car near the parking lot entrance and approached the vehicle on foot. Two adults were inside of the vehicle, who were identified as Corey Andrew, 24, and Hannah Pawelski. Wale said Andrew refused to provide identification or hand over the marijuana cigarette which was described to be in plain sight. Powell explained to Andrew that he would only receive a misdemeanor citation, at which point Andrew put his vehicle in gear and “accelerated suddenly and rapidly” into the grass and turned back into the parking lot, Wale said. The officers separated and the car came directly towards Rice. Wale said Rice believed he could not escape and in response fired his weapon at the vehicle.

         "A neighbor in the three-unit, two-story building had called 911 to say Appleby had cut Tucker's throat with a knife, then pulled her back inside from a balcony. Police arrived. Upstairs they went. They smashed out a door window, unlocked it from the inside and entered, said Lt. Don Wensel. He said the 59-year-old Appleby still had the knife blade against Tucker's throat. An officer inside the room noticed a momentary bit of physical separation between Appleby and his shield, Tucker. The officer fired his gun, then fired a second time. Appleby fell to the ground, and was later pronounced dead there.",
